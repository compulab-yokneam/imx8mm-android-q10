 Note that some frequencies produce no output in RC oscillator mode.

+All the listed RTCs support XT calibration that allows to improve the RTC
+accuracy. To perform the calibration follow the instruction:
+
+	Write the nominal frequency (in milliHerz) 32768000 to
+		/sys/class/rtc/your_rtc/xt_frequency
+		to ensure the calibration is not occurring.
+	Select the XT oscillator by writing
+		xtal to /sys/class/rtc/your_rtc/oscillator.
+	Configure a square wave SQW output on the output pin by writing
+		32768_Hz to /sys/class/rtc/your_rtc/sqw.
+	Measure the square wave frequency at the output pin in milliHz.
+	Assign the measured value to the property xt_frequency.
